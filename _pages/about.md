I am currently pursuing my Master degree at Guangzhou Institute of Technology, Xidian University, under the guidance of [Prof. Xuefeng Liang](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/xliang/index.html). Previously, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University.

My research interests mainly lie in **multimodal learning**, including topics like **imbalanced multimodal learning**, **incomplete multimodal learning**, etc., specifically in the field of **affective computing**. Additionally, I am interested in exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications, especially using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to solve the problems inherent in multimodal learning (e.g. modality dependency, modality conflict phenomena).
